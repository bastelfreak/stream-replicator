Configuring the Replicator requires having credentials and stream details for both the Source and Target streams.

If you just want to duplicate/combine streams in the same NATS Server Cluster you should probably use a [JetStream Source](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/jetstream_admin/replication)
which Choria Broker also supports.

Review the sub-sections for scenario specific details.
